If you declare a variable to a value, you're not allowed to change it to another.

For example:

Me = 5 + 5.
Output : 10

But if i want to change the variable "Me" to another value, i wont be able to

Me = 5 + 6.
is impossible

This is because Erlang uses "single assignment variables" - once a variable is bound, it cannot be rebound in the same context.

However, you can use the same variable name in different function calls or pattern matches:

factorial(0) -> 1;
factorial(N) -> N * factorial(N-1).

Each N is a new variable, despite having the same name.

You can also use pattern matching with compound data structures:

{X, Y} = {1, 2}.
[Head|Tail] = [1,2,3].

The = operator in Erlang is not an assignment operator, but a pattern matching operator.
